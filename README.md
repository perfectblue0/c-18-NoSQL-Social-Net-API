# c-18-NoSQL-Social-Net-API

## Description

I made this project to practice building an API that allows users to share their thoughts, reactions to friends’ thoughts, and create list of friends. I used Express.js for routing, Day.js to format my dates, a MongoDB database, and Mongoose ODM.

## Usage

I have provided seeded data of five users. To seed the database users must enter "npm run seed". Then users must enter “npm run start” on their terminal to run the application. Users can use Insomnia Core to create, update, view all, view a single, and delete users, thoughts, and reactions. Friends can be added and removed from users as well.
